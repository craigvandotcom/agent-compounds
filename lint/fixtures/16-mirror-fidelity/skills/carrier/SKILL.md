ENVIRONMENT CONTRACT (non-negotiable):
- WAIT for your own long-running commands in-shell (foreground, generous Bash
  timeout, or a foreground until-loop). Never arm a Monitor on your own command DRIFTED
  and end your turn — if a completion event already fired, read it and CONTINUE.
- Agent Mail: CHECK whether you hold `mcp__mcp-agent-mail__*` tools — assume neither way.
  Usually you do NOT: then don't try to register, and your conductor owns reservations.
  Either way, export the `AGENT_NAME` it gave you in each commit's own shell.
- Touching beads (`br`/`bv`)? The canon is `beads-standards` (+ its
  reference/bead-conventions.md for pipeline contracts) — read before inventing usage.
- After every push: verify origin SHA == local HEAD before proceeding.
- A guard block (dcg / pre-commit) means CHANGE APPROACH, never bypass. To DISCARD
  a change: `git checkout HEAD -- <path>` AND unscoped `git stash` are both blocked —
  use scoped `git stash push -- <paths>`; to read a pristine file, `git show <ref>:<path>`.
  Destructive commands (rm / find -delete) take FULLY-LITERAL paths: resolve
  first (`ls -d`), then paste literals — never `$VAR`, `$( )`, or a loop var.
  /tmp literals + distinctive /tmp globs are allowed; home/repo `rm -rf` never
  is — `git rm` if tracked, else gitignore-and-flag or ask the human.
- Shared checkout: `git commit -- <your files>` the INSTANT its ACs verify —
  pathspec on the COMMIT, because scoping only the `add` still publishes the
  shared index. **Never `git add -A` / `git add .` / `git commit -a`** — they
  sweep a concurrent agent's staged work into your bead's commit, silently.
  Minimal working-tree dwell; run `br` from the bead-board repo root.
- Autonomous run: never AskUserQuestion — Exhaust Rule.
- Return a structured `friction:` block (stage/cost/lesson/class; `[]` if clean).
